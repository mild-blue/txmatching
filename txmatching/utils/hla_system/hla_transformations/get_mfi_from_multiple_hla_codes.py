    Takes list of MFIs of the same hla code and estimates the MFI for the code.
    It is based on discussions with immunologists. If variance is low, take average, if variance is high, take average
    only of the lower portion of MFIs. If the calculated average is close to cutoff raise warning, each of such cases is
    to be checked by immunologist.

    The reason some antibodies occur multiple times is because antibodies existence is tested together for alpha and
    beta alleles. And we need to distinguish whether the MFI value relates to alpha or beta or both.

    To identify large variance two conditions have to be fulfilled:
     - difference between min max values has to be higher than cutoff.
     - relative difference between min max values has to be higher than RELATIVE_DIFFERENCE_THRESHOLD_FOR_SUSPICIOUS_MFI

    In such case we identify the set of the lowest MFI values and estimate the real MFI value for given hla_code only
    from them.
