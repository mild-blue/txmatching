# Frontend

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).

## Prerequisites
### Node.js and npm

npm is distributed with Node.js, which means that when you download Node.js, you automatically get npm installed on your computer.

[Download Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Verify installation by running in Terminal or Command line:
```
node -v
```
and then:
```
npm -v
```

```
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

It will globally install Angular on your machine.
