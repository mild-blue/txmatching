# Frontend

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).

## Prerequisites
### Node.js and npm

npm is distributed with Node.js, which means that when you download Node.js, you automatically get npm installed on your computer.

[Download Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Verify installation by running in Terminal or Command line:
```
node -v
```
and then:
```
npm -v
```

### Angular

In Terminal or Command line run:
```
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

It will globally install Angular on your machine.

## Before starting dev server
After downloading a new version of frontend app, you need to run `npm install` in case there is a need to install additional modules.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests
